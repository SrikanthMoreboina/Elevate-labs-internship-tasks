Task 1 Overview:
I developed a Java console-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations using user input from the Scanner class. The program uses methods, loops, and exception handling to allow multiple calculations interactively.

Interview Questions & Answers
What is method overloading?
Method overloading is defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (type, number, or order) in the same class.

How do you handle divide-by-zero?
I use an if condition to check if the divisor is zero and throw an ArithmeticException with a message like "Division by zero is undefined".

Difference between == and .equals()?
== checks if two references point to the same memory location, while .equals() checks if the values inside the objects are equal (commonly overridden in classes like String).

What are the basic data types in Java?
Java has 8 primitive data types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, and boolean.

How is Scanner used for input?
The Scanner class reads input from the user, e.g., Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); int a = sc.nextInt();

Explain the role of a loop.
A loop repeats a block of code until a specified condition is false, which helps in performing repetitive tasks like taking inputs multiple times.

Difference between while and for loop?
A while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown, while a for loop is better when the iteration count is known in advance.

What is the JVM?
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an engine that runs Java bytecode. It allows Java programs to run on any system with a compatible JVM.

How is Java platform-independent?
Java is platform-independent because the code is compiled into bytecode, which the JVM can run on any operating system.

How do you debug a Java program?
I use print statements (System.out.println), or an IDE's debugger to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through the code to find logical or runtime errors.
